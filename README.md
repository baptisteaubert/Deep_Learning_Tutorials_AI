# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

This is my personal completion of Andrew Ng MOOC on Coursera.
I highly recommend this MOOC to anyone wanting to break into Deep Learning if not AI.
Background is Python Programming, and Calculus is recommended tough not an absolute prerequisite.
I've done quiet a lot of work as to finding the support user files from different sources and rebuilding some functions that were not
open source.

Please be aware that Andrew Ng and his team have done an unique work to make AI available to the many.
