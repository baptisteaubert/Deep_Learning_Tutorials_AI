# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

This is my personal completion of Andrew Ng MOOC on Coursera.
I highly recommend this MOOC to anyone wanting to break into Deep Learning if not AI.
Background is Python Programming, and Calculus is recommended though not an absolute prerequisite.
I've done quiet a lot of work as to finding the support user files from different sources and rebuilding some Users functions that were not open source. The result is that the entire project is ready to compute with no error if you instal all the required packages in your virtual environment.
