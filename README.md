# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

This is my personal completion of Andrew Ng MOOC on Coursera.
I highly recommend this MOOC to anyone wanting to break into Deep Learning if not AI.
Background is Python Programming, and Calculus is recommended though not an absolute prerequisite.
I've done quiet a lot of work as to finding the support user files from different sources and rebuilding some Users functions that were not open source. The result is that the entire project is ready to compute with no error if you instal all the required packages in your virtual environment. 

### Additional Files
Please note that some files are to big to allow efficient communication with the remote repo. I uploaded most of the data files but some will be missing: 
* The **darknet** folder - 269,7 Mega Octets should be addded to the path "Deep_Learning_Tutorials_AI/03-Convolutional Neural Networks/Week2". It can be downloaded from: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo. 
* The file **glove.6B.50d.txt** - 187,4 Mega Octets should be added to the path "Deep_Learning_Tutorials_AI/Sequence Models/Week2/Emojify/data". It can be donladed from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove. 
* All the quizzes are removed to stay in line with Coursera Integrity Policy. You will have to do them yourself! :) 

### Getting Started
All the work has been done so that you can run all the notebooks right away. Just create a dedicated virtual env and install **requirements.txt**
If you are using your own virtualenv please run pip install -r requirements.txt 
If you are using conda please run conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
